> Generator for scaffolding out a Savvy CSS module..

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and this generator using either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/))...

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g @savvy-css/generator-savvy-css
```

... or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

```bash
yarn global add yo
yarn global add @savvy-css/generator-savvy-css
```

## Usage 

Run the `yo` command to generate your new project:

```bash
yo @savvy-css/generator-savvy-css
```

From there, the generator is setup to configure a Savvy CSS module within 
one of Savvy's [categories of concerns](https://github.com/savvy-css/savvy/blob/master/doc/architecture/design-principles.md). 

Simply select your concern (for example, "utility"), the _subject_ of your module _within_ the context of that concern (for example, "spacing"), and from there, after a few more straightforward prompts, the generator will know how to scaffold your project!

### Deployment

Each project designed to be [published on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/savvy-css) using [`np`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np).

Right now, instead of packaging `np` with each project, it's recommended to use your own
global installation: 

```shell
yarn global add np
```

or 

```shell
npm install -g np
```

#### ðŸ”‘ Important Note

The [Savvy CSS organization](https://github.com/savvy-css) currently lacks the funding for private GitHub repositories ðŸ˜›. 

This means that before packages can be published under the `@savvy-css` namespace using `np`, an initial publish will need to be done manually with the `--access publish` flag being passed.

Please do this with the `v0.0.0` files after they are generated. First, update the date in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and push the project to Github:

```shell
git remote add origin <repo_url>
git add --all
git commit -m 'released v0.0.0'
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Then create and push a tag to Github:

```shell
git tag v0.0.0
git push origin master --tags
```

Finally, publish:

```shell
npm publish --access public
```
